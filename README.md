# REST API made with GO
### It emulates a bank enviroment

The API will allow the user to create and manage Accounts wich will be composed by an owner, a balance and a currency.
Also the user will be able to create money transfers between accounts and watch the balance updated on each account.
And finally, all the records of balance changes will be stored.

## Technologies
I am going to use golang to maka the API, Postgres as SGDB and Docker to deploy de app.
